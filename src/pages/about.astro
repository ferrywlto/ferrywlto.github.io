      <span class="text-body">
        A software engineer with nearly two decades in the industry, and founder of <a href="https://verdantsparks.com" target="_blank"><b style="color: var(--color-primary)">VerdantSparks</b></a>. I love building software.
        This site is my digital garden, where I share my thoughts on technology, programming, and life.
      </span>

      <span class="text-body">
        I specialize in .NET full-stack development, covering backend APIs, frontend, mobile apps, and Azure cloud infrastructure.
        I’m at my best when bringing different technologies together into something that simply works.
      </span>

      <span class="text-body">
        My current focus is on SaaS platform development and WhatsApp integration, crafting tools that help individuals and small businesses operate more efficiently.
        I believe every idea deserves a chance to spark — and code is how I ignite them.
      </span>

      <span class="text-body">
        I live in Milton Keynes with my wife and three cats. Originally from Hong Kong, I moved to the UK in 2024 to experience a different pace of life.
        I've also been living in Taiwan for two years, where I attempted to build a SaaS company during the pandemic.
      </span>

      <span class="text-body">
        Fun facts: My name, Ferry, is a short-form of my legal name which is my family nickname that happens to sound like “ferry boat” (渡輪 ⛴️) in Cantonese. I love rodents as much as cats — one of my fancy rat was named <b style="color: var(--color-primary)">Hello 🐭</b>.

      <h2 class="text-section-title">🚀 My Career</h2>
      <span class="text-body">
        I'm not going to delve into all the details of my professional career.
        For my CV, you can check out my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of this
        page.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        Several roles throughout my career have been related to gaming. My first
        job after graduation involved R&D for casino slot-machine software,
        where I worked on both the Flash frontend and Java backend. Following
        that, I joined one of the largest horse racing organizations globally,
        also the largest taxpayer and charity in Hong Kong. Over three years
        there, I honed my skills in C#, the .NET stack, and various web
        technologies. In my sixth year, I transitioned to a mobile gaming
        company specializing in online betting and live video streaming of
        betting tables from a Cambodian casino. Interestingly, despite the
        nature of my work, I've never been a fan of gambling.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        In 2012, my fifth year in the field, I took on a System Analyst role at
        an airline company. However, I quickly discovered it wasn't a good fit
        and resigned after three months. It wasn't until three years later that
        I took on another non-pure-developer role.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        After leaving the mobile gaming company, I spent a year attempting to
        launch a dining POS system using ActionScript and MXML. Unfortunately,
        my technical knowledge fell short for a project requiring deep hardware
        integration.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        Next, I served as a System Architect at Hong Kong's largest public
        housing developer for three years. In 2018, an opportunity from a former
        supervisor led me to start my own business.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        Founded in 2018, VerdantSparks began as a digital consultancy, employing
        up to four full-time employees at its peak. During my two years in
        Taiwan, I ventured into building a Vet & Pet SaaS business. However,
        despite pitching a prototype to the Invest Taipei Office, we failed to
        secure funding. Eventually, resource constraints forced us to halt MVP
        development.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        Facing significant financial setbacks, I suspended my company, returned
        to Hong Kong, and spent about two years as a Senior Staff Software
        Engineer at a SaaS startup before relocating to the UK. My tenure at the
        startup marked another career peak. With a fantastic team, I became a
        respected leader who influenced cross-team dynamics. The CTO mentored me
        extensively, and I experienced rapid professional growth.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        However, rapid growth took a toll on my health. Stress from workload and
        office politics led to high blood pressure. Consequently, I decided to
        resign after the CTO's departure, taking a six-month career break while
        planning my move to the UK.
      </span>
      <span class="text-body">
        Today, I am a mid-level software developer at a large private
        corporation in the United States, working remotely as an individual
        contributor. Quietly preparing for my next career milestone.

      <h2 class="text-item-title">🏗️ My tech stack</h2>
      <p class="text-body">
        My tech stack slowly shifted from being Macromedia/Adobe-focused to
        .NET-focused between 2000 and 2010. I taught myself Flash and
        ActionScript during secondary school. When I attended technical college
        at the start of the 21st century, my primary IDE was Flash 4. The main
        languages I used during that time were VB6, VBScript, ASP, ActionScript,
        and some C. Over the years, I progressed from building animations to
        developing Rich Internet Applications, transitioning from ActionScript 2
        to ActionScript 3. However, Apple's decision to phase out Flash in 2010
        brought significant changes. I began learning C# around 2002, shortly
        after the release of the .NET Framework 1.0. Since then, it has become
        my primary programming language.

        🏓 Table tennis has been my favorite since primary school. After a 20-year break, I’m back at it—we play a few times a week at <b><a href="https://www.centremk.com/" target="_blank">centre:mk</a></b>.

      <span class="text-body">
        Grew up in arcades (King of Fighters, Gundam VS), later competed in Age of Empires and StarCraft, and spent time in WoW, Guild Wars, and Diablo—plus ranked LoL and PUBG. These days it’s mostly Minecraft (often with my wife) and Magic: The Gathering Arena, though I play far less than a decade ago as family and coding take priority.

        Magic: The Gathering since 1995; building Gundam model kits on holidays; bedtime reads of technical books and comics; and plenty of cat-patting. 🐈🐈🐈
