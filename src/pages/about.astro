      <h3>üßë‚Äçüíª About Me</h3>
      <p>
        A software engineer with two decades of experience in the industry, I
        love solving problems and building things. I aspire to work for myself
        one day to transform all my ideas into actual products.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tech stack is .NET-focused, with C# being my current favorite
        language. I am also curious and continually exploring various aspects of
        software development such as DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Test
        Automation, and AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding is the reason I wake up every morning, right after my wife and my
        pets. I hope to continue working in software development for as long as
        I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently live in Milton Keynes, UK, with my wife and three cats. I
        relocated from my home country, Hong Kong, around May 2025 to experience
        a different lifestyle. During the pandemic, I also lived in Taiwan for
        about two years.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name, <b>Ferry</b>, comes from a nickname given by my family members
        when I was young. It is an abbreviation of my legal name in Chinese and
        is pronounced the same as ‚Äúferry‚Äù in Cantonese (Ê∏°Ëº™ ‚õ¥Ô∏è)
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: Although I have three cats, I do like üê≠ rodents very much. I
        had a few hamsters and mouses in the past but I was heart-broken
        whenever they had to go due to their relatively short life-span.

      <h3>üöÄ My Career</h3>
      <p>
        I'm not going to delve into all the details of my professional career.
        For my CV, you can check out my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of this
        page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several roles throughout my career have been related to gaming. My first
        job after graduation involved R&D for casino slot-machine software,
        where I worked on both the Flash frontend and Java backend. Following
        that, I joined one of the largest horse racing organizations globally,
        also the largest taxpayer and charity in Hong Kong. Over three years
        there, I honed my skills in C#, the .NET stack, and various web
        technologies. In my sixth year, I transitioned to a mobile gaming
        company specializing in online betting and live video streaming of
        betting tables from a Cambodian casino. Interestingly, despite the
        nature of my work, I've never been a fan of gambling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, my fifth year in the field, I took on a System Analyst role at
        an airline company. However, I quickly discovered it wasn't a good fit
        and resigned after three months. It wasn't until three years later that
        I took on another non-pure-developer role.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving the mobile gaming company, I spent a year attempting to
        launch a dining POS system using ActionScript and MXML. Unfortunately,
        my technical knowledge fell short for a project requiring deep hardware
        integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I served as a System Architect at Hong Kong's largest public
        housing developer for three years. In 2018, an opportunity from a former
        supervisor led me to start my own business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 2018, VerdantSparks began as a digital consultancy, employing
        up to four full-time employees at its peak. During my two years in
        Taiwan, I ventured into building a Vet & Pet SaaS business. However,
        despite pitching a prototype to the Invest Taipei Office, we failed to
        secure funding. Eventually, resource constraints forced us to halt MVP
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facing significant financial setbacks, I suspended my company, returned
        to Hong Kong, and spent about two years as a Senior Staff Software
        Engineer at a SaaS startup before relocating to the UK. My tenure at the
        startup marked another career peak. With a fantastic team, I became a
        respected leader who influenced cross-team dynamics. The CTO mentored me
        extensively, and I experienced rapid professional growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, rapid growth took a toll on my health. Stress from workload and
        office politics led to high blood pressure. Consequently, I decided to
        resign after the CTO's departure, taking a six-month career break while
        planning my move to the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I am a mid-level software developer at a large private
        corporation in the United States, working remotely as an individual
        contributor. Quietly preparing for my next career milestone.

      <h3>üèóÔ∏è My tech stack</h3>
      <p>
        My tech stack slowly shifted from being Macromedia/Adobe-focused to
        .NET-focused between 2000 and 2010. I taught myself Flash and
        ActionScript during secondary school. When I attended technical college
        at the start of the 21st century, my primary IDE was Flash 4. The main
        languages I used during that time were VB6, VBScript, ASP, ActionScript,
        and some C. Over the years, I progressed from building animations to
        developing Rich Internet Applications, transitioning from ActionScript 2
        to ActionScript 3. However, Apple's decision to phase out Flash in 2010
        brought significant changes. I began learning C# around 2002, shortly
        after the release of the .NET Framework 1.0. Since then, it has become
        my primary programming language.
      </p>

          home shortly after the time we first met. Marking how long since I and
          Elaine met each other. A polite boy that is not a picky eater. He is
          friendly to human thus being our receptionist.

          Shamy is a pretty domestic ginger white. Elaine adopted her from a
          young korean lady after a year we get married due to I like ginger
          cat. Her name is a combination of Sheldon and Amy from the Big Bang
          Theory. Resumbling her shy and quiet personality.

          stopped the car and pick him up such that he don't follow the tragic
          fate of his parent and siblings. Seven is playful and always hungry.
          He is the biggest in size among three.

      <h3>üëæ My Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Hobbies with my wife</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              üé• We enjoy watching movies at cinemas and Netflix series at home.
            </li>
            <li>
              üë´üèª We also love go out and for small walks along lakes and parks.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              üèì Table Tennis has been my favorite sport since primary school. I
              took a nearly twenty-year break from it after secondary school,
              but I've recently picked it up again since getting married.
            </li>
            <li>
              üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Additionally, I enjoy cycling during cooler days and have
              developed an interest in üèπ archery.
            </li>
            <li>
              üè∏ I play badminton occasionally, although I'm not particularly
              skilled at it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>üéÆ Video Games</h4>
        <p>
          During my youth, I immersed myself in video games. Countless hours
          were spent in arcades enjoying games like the King of Fighters and
          Gundam VS Gundam series. I competed competitively in Age of Empires
          and StarCraft before the term eSports gained popularity. My gaming
          adventures extended to World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and the
          challenging realms of Diablo. Besides, I strived for ranks in games
          like League of Legends and PUBG. However, the game that occupies most
          of my gaming time now is Minecraft and Magic: The Gathering Arena.
          Playing Minecraft with my wife is a particular joy. Compared to a
          decade ago, my gaming habits have significantly reduced as my
          attention is now dedicated to coding and family life.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>üìö Other Hobbies</h4>
        <p>
          I started playing and collecting Magic the Gathering cards since 1995.
          During some long holidays, I built Gundam Model Kits. I also enjoy
          reading technical books and comics before bedtime. And last but not
          least, I love petting my cats. üêàüêàüêà
