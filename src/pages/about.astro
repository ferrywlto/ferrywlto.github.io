		<div>Bio</div>
		<div>
			Hello, I'm Ferry—software engineer, architect, and founder. With almost two decades of experience building robust, scalable systems, I specialise in the .NET ecosystem, system architecture, and AI-driven applications.
			
			Originally from Hong Kong and now based in the UK, I've navigated roles from senior engineer to technical lead across global enterprises, innovative startups, and my own micro-SaaS ventures. My passion lies in crafting elegant software solutions, mentoring teams, and championing engineering excellence through practical wisdom and quiet leadership.
			
			Currently, I'm deeply focused on developing AI-powered micro-SaaS products, blending cutting-edge technology with real-world usability—particularly in domains close to my heart, like pet care. Outside coding, you'll find me sharing my journey, insights, and technical discoveries right here, alongside lessons learned from building products and nurturing communities.
			
			Welcome to my digital home—where thoughtful engineering meets real-life stories.
