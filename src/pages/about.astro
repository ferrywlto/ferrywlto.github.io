  `A software engineer with nearly two decades in the industry,
   and founder of <a href=\"https://verdantsparks.com\" target=\"_blank\"><b style=\"color: var(--color-primary)\">VerdantSparks</b></a>.
   I love building software. This site is my digital garden, where I share my thoughts on technology, programming, and life.`,
  `I specialize in .NET full-stack development, covering backend APIs,
   frontend, mobile apps, and Azure cloud infrastructure. I’m at my best
   when bringing different technologies together into something that simply works.`,
  `My current focus is on SaaS platform development and WhatsApp
   integration, crafting tools that help individuals and small businesses
   operate more efficiently. I believe every idea deserves a chance to
   spark — and code is how I ignite them.`,
  `I live in Milton Keynes with my wife and three cats. Originally from
   Hong Kong, I moved to the UK in 2024 to experience a different pace of
   life. I've also been living in Taiwan for two years, where I attempted
   to build a SaaS company during the pandemic.`,
  `<b>Fun facts:</b> My name, Ferry, is a short-form of my legal name which
  is my family nickname that happens to sound like “ferry boat” (渡輪 ⛴️)
  in Cantonese. I love rodents as much as cats — one of my fancy rats was
  named <b style="color: var(--color-primary)">Hello 🐭</b>. I once looked after more than 20 rescued hamsters.`,
