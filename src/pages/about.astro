      <p class="text-body">
        A software engineer with two decades of experience in the industry, I
        love solving problems and building things. I aspire to work for myself
        one day to transform all my ideas into actual products.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        My tech stack is .NET-focused, with C# being my current favorite
        language. I am also curious and continually exploring various aspects of
        software development such as DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, Test
        Automation, and AI.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        Coding is the reason I wake up every morning, right after my wife and my
        pets. I hope to continue working in software development for as long as
        I can.
      </p>

      <p class="text-body">
        I currently live in Milton Keynes, UK, with my wife and three cats. I
        relocated from my home country, Hong Kong, around May 2025 to experience
        a different lifestyle. During the pandemic, I also lived in Taiwan for
        about two years.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        My name, <b>Ferry</b>, comes from a nickname given by my family members
        when I was young. It is an abbreviation of my legal name in Chinese and
        is pronounced the same as ‚Äúferry‚Äù in Cantonese (Ê∏°Ëº™ ‚õ¥Ô∏è)
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Fun fact: Although I have three cats, I do like üê≠ rodents very much. I
        had a few hamsters and mouses in the past but I was heart-broken
        whenever they had to go due to their relatively short life-span.

      <h2 class="text-item-title">üöÄ My Career</h2>
      <p class="text-body">
        I'm not going to delve into all the details of my professional career.
        For my CV, you can check out my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of this
        page.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Several roles throughout my career have been related to gaming. My first
        job after graduation involved R&D for casino slot-machine software,
        where I worked on both the Flash frontend and Java backend. Following
        that, I joined one of the largest horse racing organizations globally,
        also the largest taxpayer and charity in Hong Kong. Over three years
        there, I honed my skills in C#, the .NET stack, and various web
        technologies. In my sixth year, I transitioned to a mobile gaming
        company specializing in online betting and live video streaming of
        betting tables from a Cambodian casino. Interestingly, despite the
        nature of my work, I've never been a fan of gambling.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        In 2012, my fifth year in the field, I took on a System Analyst role at
        an airline company. However, I quickly discovered it wasn't a good fit
        and resigned after three months. It wasn't until three years later that
        I took on another non-pure-developer role.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        After leaving the mobile gaming company, I spent a year attempting to
        launch a dining POS system using ActionScript and MXML. Unfortunately,
        my technical knowledge fell short for a project requiring deep hardware
        integration.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Next, I served as a System Architect at Hong Kong's largest public
        housing developer for three years. In 2018, an opportunity from a former
        supervisor led me to start my own business.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Founded in 2018, VerdantSparks began as a digital consultancy, employing
        up to four full-time employees at its peak. During my two years in
        Taiwan, I ventured into building a Vet & Pet SaaS business. However,
        despite pitching a prototype to the Invest Taipei Office, we failed to
        secure funding. Eventually, resource constraints forced us to halt MVP
        development.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Facing significant financial setbacks, I suspended my company, returned
        to Hong Kong, and spent about two years as a Senior Staff Software
        Engineer at a SaaS startup before relocating to the UK. My tenure at the
        startup marked another career peak. With a fantastic team, I became a
        respected leader who influenced cross-team dynamics. The CTO mentored me
        extensively, and I experienced rapid professional growth.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        However, rapid growth took a toll on my health. Stress from workload and
        office politics led to high blood pressure. Consequently, I decided to
        resign after the CTO's departure, taking a six-month career break while
        planning my move to the UK.
      </p>
      <p class="text-body">
        Today, I am a mid-level software developer at a large private
        corporation in the United States, working remotely as an individual
        contributor. Quietly preparing for my next career milestone.

      <h2 class="text-item-title">üèóÔ∏è My tech stack</h2>
      <p class="text-body">
        My tech stack slowly shifted from being Macromedia/Adobe-focused to
        .NET-focused between 2000 and 2010. I taught myself Flash and
        ActionScript during secondary school. When I attended technical college
        at the start of the 21st century, my primary IDE was Flash 4. The main
        languages I used during that time were VB6, VBScript, ASP, ActionScript,
        and some C. Over the years, I progressed from building animations to
        developing Rich Internet Applications, transitioning from ActionScript 2
        to ActionScript 3. However, Apple's decision to phase out Flash in 2010
        brought significant changes. I began learning C# around 2002, shortly
        after the release of the .NET Framework 1.0. Since then, it has become
        my primary programming language.
