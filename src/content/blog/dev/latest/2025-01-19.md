I have a habit to do leetcode questions sequentially. Last week I encountered 14 questions in a row about Pandas, which I think worth to do a little recap to enhance my memory. When I was learning Machine Learning 7-8 years ago. (The famous course on Coursera by [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/).) I was using Octave and then didn't touch Python / Pandas for a long time as I am a full-stack .NET guy. Before I can start solving those questions. I have to setup the testing environment to verify my code. It is always good to document how do I setup such a Python unit-testing environment from scratch. This is more easier to use than I was expected, except some discrepancy during Python setup.

## Setup Python

<!-- These are the first questions in Python that I have encountered on Leetcode.  -->

1. Check if Python installed:
```
python3 --version
```

If not:
```
brew install python3
```

2. Create virtual environment, isolated environment with a standalone python installation with pip installed in root directory:

```
python3 -m venv .
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source bin/activate
```

4. Install pytest:
```
python3 -m pip install pytest
```

5. Deactivate the virtual environment (In case needed)
```
deactivate
```
## Setup Python unit-testing

There are two major unit testing framework in Python:
- unittest
- pytest

### `pytest` vs `unittest`

| Feature           | `pytest`                          | `unittest`                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Installation      | Third-party (`pip install pytest`)| Built-in (part of standard library)|
| Test Structure    | Function-based                    | Class-based                       |
| Boilerplate Code  | Less                              | More                              |
| Assertions        | Simple `assert` statements        | Methods like `self.assertEqual`   |
| Advanced Features | Fixtures, parameterized testing, plugins | Limited                           |
| Test Discovery    | Automatic                         | Requires `unittest` discovery     |

I choose `pytest` as it work in a modern way.

To use `pytest`:
```python
pip install pytest
```

To run test for a file
```
pytest filename.py
```

To get output from `print()`
```
pytest -s filename.py
```

Run all tests in a folder
```
pytest
```

**Test files must either start with `test_` or end with `_test.py`**

And you are all done:

<!-- ### Setup Pandas
Pandas is all about manipulating data (DataFrame)

To use Pandas, import it from `pd`:

```python
import pandas as pd
``` -->
<!-- 
### Create a 

```csharp
for (var j = 31; j >= 0; j--)
{
    if (kOrBits[j] == 1)
    {
        var power = 32 - j - 1;
        result += (int)Math.Pow(2, power);
    }
}
```

```csharp
for (var j = 31; j >= 0; j--)
{
    if (kOrBits[j] == 1)
    {
        result |= (1 << (31 - j));
    }
}
``` -->
